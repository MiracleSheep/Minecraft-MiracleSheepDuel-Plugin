It also has a kit feature, that allows you to create new kits to equip and duel others with

# Features
* A /duel command which reads the kits in the config.yml and brings up a custom inventory.
* Compatibility with multiworld, name your duel world "Arena" specify the coordinates of you arena in the config
*  a /equip and /unequip kit, capable of saving your inventory.
* a /ktlist and /kititems command, allowing you to see the kits you have in the config and what items they have

# Planned updates
* allows enchanted items as part of a kit
* Making the config easier to understand

## Implemented so far:
* Config is fully organized
* Items can have up to six enchantments
* Amount and durability of each item can be customized
* Duel kit Icons that appear in the selection screen can be customized in the config
* Custom locations and arenas can be set for each kit
* Illegal enchantments can be toggled on and off in the config
* A clone world feature has been added where the plugin will make a clone of your duel world and send the players to that instead, then delete it when the players are done (optionnal, can be set to true or false in the config)
* depends and uses multiverse API

## To be implemented
* Golden heads(might not, not really neccesary. Was thinking about 1.8.9 when i thought up this feature, but considering that I am using it in 1.16.4, probabbly won't add)
* Bug fixes involving the accept command while in a duel and multiple people dueling at the same time
* a /spectate feature and coordinates in the config where spectators will warp to based on the arena and kit selected
* *General polishing*
